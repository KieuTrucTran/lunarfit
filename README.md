## Local dev servers

You can set up the backend including the database using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and the `docker-compose.yml`.

``` sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

You can stop and remove the containers using `docker compose down`. There are also `start` `stop` and `restart` commands, which will keep the containers state. You probably don't need these here. In case the containers are running the `up` command takes care of removing and rebuilding them.

The backend is accessible at port 8000. You can access the API endpoint documentation at <localhost:8000>. For more information look at the backend `Readme` and `Dockerfile`.

The containers start in detached mode. If you need to monitor their output you can ommit the `d` flag, attach to the containers output using `docker attach [CONTAINERNAME]` or use Docker Desktop to inspect them. If you use VSCode there is an extension that can interact with containers as well.

> ðŸ™Š The frontend service is currently disabled, as it needs adjustments for the Quasar CLI. `docker compose up` will only start the backend

>>>
The frontend is accessible at port 5173 (standard vite dev port).
You can limit the services that run by specifying `frontend` or `backend`.
Note that `backend` will start `db` as well.
This way you can use a local frontend dev server, but still have a working backend.

### First run - Database setup

The first time you run this will take a while, because it downloads and installs all the images and dependencies.

After that you need to initialize the backend database with. Also necessary if you change backend models.

``` sh
docker compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
```

### Create a superuser

A superuser can be useful to browse the API or if you work on admin stuff.

If you need a superuser, run:
``` sh
docker compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You only need to do this the first time, since the database creates a persistent volume.

Adding the `-v` flag to `docker compose down` will remove the persistent database volume. In case there is trouble. After that you will need to repeat the database setup. If you work on Django models, you can `makemigrations` and `migrate` while the containers are running.

## Browse the API-Documentation

The backend's API is automatically documented and browsable in different ways.
When the backend server is running (in dev mode) the standard Django-Rest-Framework view on the API is available at the server root: <http://localhost:8000>
This page enables you to send HTTP requests to the running server and actually use the API.

You can log in with an existing user and view the API with the permissions of that user. For example logging in with a normal user account, you can only update or delete that specific user's data.
If you set up a [superuser](#create-a-superuser) you can browse, update, delete all the available records and create new ones with the privileges of a database admin, through the available endpoints.

### OpenAPI 3 Schema

The backend automatically generates an API schema using [drf-spectacular](https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
You can download the schema as YAML from `/api/schema`, to use with any tool you like.
It is also possible to generate schema through the [CLI](https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#take-it-for-a-spin).

The simplest way is to browse the API Schema in a [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) or [Redoc](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/) frontend. These are available in the backend at [/api/schema/swagger-ui](http://localhost:8000/api/schema/swagger-ui/) and [/api/schema/redoc/](http://localhost:8000/api/schema/redoc/), without any additional setup.
